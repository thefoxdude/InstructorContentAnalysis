In this class, I want you to exclusively use the **size()** version, not length()

Also, the text says that the string member function find returns -1 when the target is not found: *this is only partly true!* 
It returns a special number called npos, which can be cast to the integer -1. 
The **ONLY** correct way to test whether find has (or has not) found its target in a string is to compare the return value to this special value npos (to tell the compiler where to find the definition of npos, you have to write `string::npos`):
```
if (word.find(target) != string::npos) {...} //if target WAS found
if (word.find(target) == string::npos ) {...} //if target was NOT found

1) List the point-to-point paths for R: (a,d), (d,c), (c,d), (b,b), (b,c).
2) List the point-to-point paths for S: (b,a), (b,d), (d,c).
3) Start with the pairs in R and see if there is a continuation of the path in S.
(a,d) to (d,c) yields (a,c)
(d,c) does not continue in S
(c,d) to (d,c) yields (c,c)
(b,b) to (b,a) yields (b,a)
(b,b) to (b,d) yields (b,d)
(b,c) does not continue in S

You have the basics now of how to build a MATLAB function that can deal do a computation given inputs you supply, and give back to you the results (outputs) of the computation.  including flow charting. A widely used current methodology is \""incremental programming\"". Put this idea firmly in your mind. INPUTS TO A FUNCTION... OUTPUTS FROM THE FUNCTION. That implies the steps for you to take when you first sit down to design a function then implement it. Programing is best thought of as TWO steps: design, then implement. Programming in fact is distinctly an engineering activity! The first step in design is to be sure you understand what inputs you will send a function, AND what outputs come back from the function. If you don't have a firm target in programming (or an engineering task) then you cannot hit that target!!T he second step in design is to get a framework for your implementation. That framework you will use from this point forward in 1101 is \incremental programming\"". Over the years there have been many frameworks proposed to help programmers. Below you will find the authors of your ZYBook have one early step that is \""write a script\"". Note as you read that they go on quickly to \""encapsulating that script in a function. In 1101 we have skipped that step of using a script. By the end of this term you will understand why. This chapter ends with an example focused on the \""green monster\"" at Fenway Park in Boston. The example shows the steps in designing and implementing  starting with a given problem about the green monster and ending with a working program that solves the problem. My suggestion is you read this chapter once quickly for the BigPicture then go back and read for details. There is a lot of \""meat\"" in this writing. Finally  as you read this chapter there are some things that will be unfamiliar to you. The code in Figure 4.1.4 has some lines that you will not initially understand because we have not covered them yet. Do not worry about the specifics here. Its the flow of the work that is important: the idea of how to develop code incrementally.

The [2] is the index value.  Indexes start at 0.

Additionally when you want to find out the length of a string you can you the len function.  For example:

Lengthofmystring = len(mystring)

So Lengthofmystring is 6.

When assigning a variable a value, Python assumes it is local, and if not already in use, will make a new object - unless the variable is declared global, in which case Python will use the global variable.

Much processing that you might do involves manipulating string data, for example, reformatting data files so that the data can be input to various programs and packages. Being able to do this is not only valuable for your own work but also provides you with a skill that is valuable to others. This applies to all disciplines not only STEM. In fact you might argue it is more valuable to other disciplines. For example, my own work in corpus linguistics with the English Department is making excellent use of string manipulation. I.e., much, if not most, computing does not involve solving math and science problems.

For now you have only seen user input, but when we get to file processing, you will see more the usefulness of these techniques as you may read in files with large numbers of data points.

Likewise, converting from large to small format, the system will attempt to do the right thing.  We only lose when we try to convert a number that is too small or large in magnitude to fit into the small format.

The gas equation PV=nRT is the equation you need to use, but you only have some of the parts. You have P, n, R, and T and need to solve for V. Algebraically, the resulting equation is:

You don't have to keep typing in n - 1, n - 2, etc.  Additionally when testing know that the provided test data may be unclear.  The program needs to input, for instance the value 5.
