3,4774,12/22/2014 17:52,"You will see below a string member function called length(), which has an alias size()
In this class, I want you to exclusively use the **size()** version, not length()

Also, the text says that the string member function find returns -1 when the target is not found: *this is only partly true!* 
It returns a special number called npos, which can be cast to the integer -1. 
The **ONLY** correct way to test whether find has (or has not) found its target in a string is to compare the return value to this special value npos (to tell the compiler where to find the definition of npos, you have to write `string::npos`):
```
if (word.find(target) != string::npos) {...} //if target WAS found
if (word.find(target) == string::npos ) {...} //if target was NOT found

To simplify things for you, I have told you to ALWAYS use reference parameters for ALL vectors & strings;
the text is more nuanced (correctly), and says that for vectors & strings known to be small, you should use value parameters.

While this is correct, you may ignore it, and continue to use ONLY reference parameters for ALL vectors & strings.
You still must understand when to use the const modifier with reference parameters.",2,833,2,CS10: Intro to Programming,CS10Summer2014,3500,Summer School 2014,,4/23/2014 18:25,9/23/2014 18:25,0,NULL,0,1,1,1,0,8/4/2014 18:37,"Note: This zyBook has add-ons using Zyante's remotely-hosted code development environment (zyde) for coding practice activities and for auto-graded homework activities.
